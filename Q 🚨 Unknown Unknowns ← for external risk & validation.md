# 🧠 Unknown Unknowns — Strategic Founder Discovery Guide

This document exists to help surface the blind spots, bottlenecks, and knowledge gaps that may not be obvious while building the ScraperSky system and broader Last Apple strategy.

This is not a checklist—it’s a **thinking tool**. Designed to keep your growth intentional, and to help you identify what needs to be delegated, learned, or validated before you scale.

---

## 🧭 1. Strategic Awareness

- What assumptions am I making about the market that haven’t been tested?
- Are there regulatory or compliance dynamics I’m ignoring?
- What does “too early to scale” look like for this system?
- Who would *challenge* my current roadmap if they saw it—and what would they question?
- Am I still solving a *strategic* problem, or has it become tactical?

---

## 💼 2. Go-To-Market & Monetization

- Have I clearly identified who *feels pain now* and is ready to pay?
- Am I building for users, buyers, or both? Are they the same?
- What channels am I ignoring that may be cost-effective or mission-aligned (e.g., ecosystem partnerships, portfolio perks)?
- Do I know how to price for *value*, not time or features?
- Where is my “first revenue funnel” blocked right now?

---

## 🧱 3. Architecture & Infrastructure Risk

- Where is technical debt silently growing?
- What part of the system could scale *poorly* under load?
- What integrations are fragile or unmonitored?
- Do I know the security, reliability, and uptime expectations of my ideal customer?
- Am I overbuilding any part of the stack for future needs that aren’t validated?

---

## 🤝 4. People, Team & Delegation

- What am I holding onto that someone else could do better?
- Do I have someone who challenges my assumptions regularly?
- If I needed to onboard a technical co-founder or team lead today, what would be missing?
- Am I building a business that supports *my energy* or drains it?
- How do I know when it’s time to hire, partner, or pause?

---

## 📈 5. Strategic Leverage & Scale

- What parts of my product or system are repeatable enough to be packaged?
- Where could AI replace me—or complement me—right now?
- What does “scale without compromise” look like for my current roadmap?
- What does the system *not* know yet because I haven’t told it?
- What can only be seen from 10,000 feet, and who is flying there?

> This is your mirror—not to reflect who you are, but to illuminate where you haven’t looked yet.

Use this document to regularly provoke new thought. Add answers, link supporting research, or flag areas for delegation and focus.

Your greatest threat isn’t failure—it’s building the wrong thing *too well*.
