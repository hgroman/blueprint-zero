# 📘 README ← Blueprint Zero Index

> **ScraperSky** is a strategic intelligence platform.
> **Blueprint Zero** is not a product—it's the internal operating system I created to keep my direction clear while building it.
> These files document the thinking, alignment, and infrastructure that protect the integrity of what ScraperSky is, and what it is becoming.

This directory is your command system—the internal architecture of clarity, scale, and truth behind everything you build.

Each file in this directory holds a different strategic altitude. Together, they create a decision stack for your work, your partnerships, your product, and your posture.

**Version:** Blueprint Zero v1.0
**Date:** April 2025
