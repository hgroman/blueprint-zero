# Vector Database Strategy for Blueprint Zero

This document outlines the initial strategy and planning for the implementation of a vector database within Blueprint Zero. Building upon the [v2 Vision Spec](docs/system/v2-vision-spec.md) and the requirement for a consistent journaling system as a primary data source, this strategy focuses on enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of vectorized data, particularly from DART Journal Entries.

## 1. Metadata Schema Definition

To enable effective scoped querying and filtering alongside vector similarity search, a well-defined metadata schema is crucial. The metadata associated with each vector embedding should capture relevant context from the source data, especially DART Journal Entries.

Potential metadata fields for DART Journal Entries:

*   **`timestamp`**: ISO 8601 formatted string representing the creation or modification time of the journal entry. (Type: Datetime)
*   **`source`**: String identifying the origin of the journal entry (e.g., "DART Journal", "System Log", "User Input"). (Type: String)
*   **`tags`**: Array of strings representing keywords or categories associated with the entry. (Type: Array of Strings)
*   **`related_entities`**: Array of identifiers or references to other entities within the Blueprint Zero system (e.g., task IDs, user IDs, document IDs). (Type: Array of Strings/UUIDs)
*   **`user_context`**: Identifier or information about the user who created or is associated with the entry. (Type: String/UUID)
*   **`entry_type`**: String indicating the specific type of journal entry (e.g., "Task Update", "Code Change", "Meeting Note"). (Type: String)
*   **`sentiment`**: Optional field for sentiment analysis results (e.g., "positive", "neutral", "negative"). (Type: String)
*   **`project_id`**: Identifier for the project or context the entry belongs to. (Type: String/UUID)
*   **`original_text_length`**: Integer representing the length of the original text content. (Type: Integer)

The schema should be flexible enough to accommodate metadata from other potential data sources in the future.

## 2. Data Ingestion Pipeline

The data ingestion pipeline is responsible for processing raw data, transforming it into a suitable format, generating vector embeddings, and storing both the vectors and their associated metadata in the vector database.

The process for ingesting DART Journal Entries:

1.  **Source Monitoring/Polling:** The pipeline monitors or is triggered by new or updated DART Journal Entries.
2.  **Data Extraction:** Extract the relevant text content and metadata fields from the journal entry.
3.  **Text Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean the text content (e.g., remove markdown formatting, special characters, stop words) to prepare it for embedding.
4.  **Embedding Generation:** Use a selected embedding model (e.g., Sentence-BERT, OpenAI Embeddings) to generate a high-dimensional vector representation of the cleaned text content.
5.  **Metadata Extraction and Formatting:** Extract and format the defined metadata fields according to the schema.
6.  **Data Packaging:** Package the vector embedding, the original text content (optional, for context), and the extracted metadata together.
7.  **Vector Database Insertion:** Insert the packaged data into the vector database. This involves storing the vector and indexing the associated metadata for efficient filtering.
8.  **Error Handling and Monitoring:** Implement robust error handling and monitoring to ensure data integrity and pipeline reliability.

Considerations:
*   Choice of embedding model and its impact on vector size and semantic representation.
*   Scalability of the pipeline to handle a large volume of journal entries.
*   Handling of updates and deletions of journal entries in the vector database.

## 3. Querying Interface Considerations

The querying interface will provide the means for users and other system components to retrieve information from the vector database. It should support various query types to leverage the capabilities of the vector database.

Key querying capabilities:

*   **Similarity Search:** Given a query vector (generated from a query string), find the most similar vectors in the database based on a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity).
*   **Metadata Filtering:** Filter search results based on specific metadata values or ranges (e.g., entries from a specific user, within a date range, with certain tags).
*   **Combined Queries:** Support combining similarity search with metadata filtering to perform scoped searches (e.g., find similar entries to a query, but only from a specific project and within the last week).
*   **Hybrid Search:** Explore combining vector search with traditional keyword-based search for more comprehensive results.
*   **Pagination and Ranking:** Implement pagination for large result sets and consider ranking strategies that might combine similarity score with other factors (e.g., recency, relevance).

Potential API Design Considerations:
*   RESTful API or GraphQL endpoint for querying.
*   Input parameters for query string, metadata filters, number of results, etc.
*   Output format including retrieved text content, metadata, and similarity scores.
*   Authentication and authorization to ensure data privacy.

This strategy provides a foundational plan for integrating a vector database into Blueprint Zero, focusing on leveraging DART Journal Entries as a primary data source for enhanced search and retrieval capabilities. Further detailed design and implementation planning will be required for each component.
