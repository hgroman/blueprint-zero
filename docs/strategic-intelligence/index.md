# Strategic Intelligence

This section of the Blueprint Zero documentation focuses on the strategic intelligence that informs the system's direction and the ScraperSky roadmap.

## Contents:

-   **[Roadmap](roadmap.md)**: The evolving roadmap for the ScraperSky strategic intelligence platform.
-   **[External Risks & Validation](external-risks-validation.md)**: Identifying blind spots, bottlenecks, and knowledge gaps.
-   **[Ingested Reports](ingested-reports/index.md)**: Raw or processed external intelligence reports.

This intelligence is crucial for grounding our strategy in external reality and identifying actionable opportunities.
