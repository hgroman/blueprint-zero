# ðŸš€ Blueprint Zero â€“ v2 Vision Spec

## Purpose
To define the next evolution of Blueprint Zero as a **living founder intelligence system**â€”bridging personal reflection, document indexing, and AI orchestration into one unified strategic framework.

This document outlines the technical and operational architecture required to move Blueprint Zero from a human-curated reflection system (v1.0) into a **semi-autonomous, founder-aligned, prompt-driven decision engine.**

---

## Guiding Premise
Youâ€”the founderâ€”are the first test subject.
ScraperSky is the first product born through this loop.

If the system works, it becomes replicable. Blueprint Zero becomes not just a system **for you**, but a productized operating layer **for others like you**.

## Core Functional Pillars

### 1. Thoughtstream Ingestion
- Journaling entries, reflection logs, verbal dumps, and work order notes
- Tagged by AI agents (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT) with:
  - Timestamp
  - Related Q-doc prompt(s)
  - Contradictions or reinforcements to `Final Answers`
  - Artifact implications (bio change, pitch refinement, etc.)

### 2. Supabase + Vector Embedding Index
- All files dropped into a local `docs/` or `assets/` directory are:
  - Auto-ingested
  - Chunked
  - Embedded into pgvector index
- Vector search enables recall based on meaning, not filenames

### 3. Multi-Agent Prompter Framework
- **Digital Shrink**: Tracks personal growth, contradictions, pattern drift
- **Strategic Prompter**: Surfaces missing answers, out-of-sync positioning
- **Product Architect**: Challenges assumptions, proposes new structure
- **Narrative Mirror**: Translates insight into founder bios, slides, pitches

Each agent operates from the same context stack but with different priorities and goals.

### 4. Artifact Generation Layer
- Each reflection or log entry is scanned for outputs:
  - Updated bio
  - New GTM one-liner
  - Blog seed
  - Slide concept
- These are written to `/artifacts/` or indexed in KM

### 5. Feedback & Correction Loop
- When contradictions arise (log vs. final answer):
  - Agent flags discrepancy
  - Suggests follow-up prompt
  - Proposes new version tag (v1.1, etc.)

---

## Minimum Viable Implementation
- Supabase with pgvector
- Claude + Cursor + ChatGPT reflection processors
- Single markdown log format (`Q - Strategic Reflection Log`)
- Weekly "check-in" queries from shrink agent

---

## Future-State Vision
Blueprint Zero becomes:
- A founder onboarding system
- A pitch construction engine
- A memory-aware assistant trainer
- A leadership evolution mirror
- A sellable product for vision-driven founders building non-bullshit systems

This is not a personal growth tool.
It is a **strategic self-indexing operating system** for founders leading with purpose.
