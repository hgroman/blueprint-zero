# Q - Strategic Pillars ← for scale, structure, signal

This document is for anchoring the strategic architecture of your platform and business model. It's the middle layer between vision and execution—the principles that keep your systems aligned with what matters.

These are the structural questions. They guide your **scale**, define your **signal filters**, and protect your **operating integrity**.

## 🧩 1. Signal Architecture

**Why it matters:** You're not trying to collect everything. You're trying to surface what's *true and timely*.

- What constitutes “signal” in ScraperSky?
- What sources are given weight, and why?
- How should conflicting data be resolved?
- What makes something noise, even if it's popular?
- How do I embed signal validation into the system design?

## 🎯 2. Target Profiles — Who This Is For

**Why it matters:** Fit matters more than reach. The wrong user is a tax.

- Who are my primary customer/operator archetypes?
- What traits show they’re ready—not just curious?
- What industries or stages are *strategically aligned* with my build?
- Who’s an anti-persona? Who should I disqualify early?
- How does ScraperSky serve operators, not opportunists?

## 📦 3. Product Packaging Philosophy

**Why it matters:** Products teach people how to treat you. Packaging is power.

- What’s the minimum viable packaging for ScraperSky?
- How will I differentiate between productized services vs. true SaaS?
- What stays sacred (never offered as a feature)?
- What does “value delivery at scale” *feel like* for both me and the client?
- What packaging would I regret locking myself into too soon?

## 📈 4. Founder Evolution Map

**Why it matters:** Your growth is the company’s roadmap.

- What identity shift am I actively undergoing?
- What kind of system architect do I need to become?
- What’s the difference between how I used to lead, and how I lead now?
- What am I being called to let go of, structurally?
- What story will this season of work tell, ten years from now?
