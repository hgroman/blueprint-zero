## 🧠 What Is Blueprint Zero?

Blueprint Zero is no longer just a document archive.

It is an experiment in building a live, recursive intelligence system—designed for founders who want to lead with clarity, direction, and long-term coherence.

This system combines:
- Strategic self-reflection (the Q-level documents)
- Versioned truth (💎 Final Answers)
- Real-time evolution tracking (via the Reflection Log)
- AI-readable indexing and clustering (via the Knowledge Management system)

You are not just reading notes here.
You are looking at the blueprint for a **cognitive operating system**—tested in real time, by the founder of ScraperSky, to ensure decisions align with purpose, execution reflects truth, and momentum produces market clarity.

ScraperSky is the first product born from this system.
The founder, Hank Groman, is its first test subject.

This is not a startup journal.
It's a strategic consciousness engine.
